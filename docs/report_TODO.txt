Here is a point-by-point list of the project report. See CS372 - Project.pdf
on URCourses for details on the task. If you are assigned to a task, and you
think you may need some more time or some help, please let the
group know. Please mark once you have completed the tasks, and also put
down your name if you have reviewed another person's task.

NOTE: There are still some areas where we haven't fully decided who will
complete the work (namely, 7c and the slides).
