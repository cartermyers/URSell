- Login/Sign Up Buttons
  Whenever I use these buttons on a half-screen, or a smaller screen device,
  the drop down menu does not go away when I select them. I think this is
  because they are a <button> tag. If they are switched to an <a> tag with
  href=#, I think it works fine, but I haven't looked into it much.

  <li class="nav-item"><button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tmNavbar" class="tm-intro-link2" id = "sign-and-log" onclick="document.getElementById('id01').style.display='block'" style="width:auto;">Login</button></li>
  <li class="nav-item"><button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tmNavbar" class="tm-intro-link2" onclick="document.getElementById('id02').style.display='block'" style="width:auto;">Sign Up</button> </li>
I add {data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tmNavbar"} to the log in and sign up buttons and right now it works on my website.
and I add this
onclick="document.getElementById('id01').style.display='block';document.getElementById('id02').style.display='none'"
to these buttons so it can cancel each other out when user click on one another.
