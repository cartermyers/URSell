- Login/Sign Up Buttons
  Whenever I use these buttons on a half-screen, or a smaller screen device,
  the drop down menu does not go away when I select them. I think this is
  because they are a <button> tag. If they are switched to an <a> tag with
  href=#, I think it works fine, but I haven't looked into it much.
