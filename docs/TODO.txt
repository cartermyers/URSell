A simple list of current things we need to do.
Maybe we should organize this by language or page or
something, for now it's just a list.

- Finish sign up
  - html return errors
  - testing

- Log in
  - Separate html for a logged in user (should be on the login branch)
  - Serve user image and username (maybe store in session?)

etc.
