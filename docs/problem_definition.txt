With the growing price of textbooks (and overall cost of living for students), there has been a demand to not only find inexpensive textbooks, but to also sell textbooks that are no longer needed. While there are generic options for students to advertise and search for textbooks, there is no dedicated, reputable mediator. By creating URSell, we hope to host a trusted source of buying, selling, and trading dedicated to university members. Whether it be textbooks, furniture, or even tutoring services, students should be able to easily find and display.
